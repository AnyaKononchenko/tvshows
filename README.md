## TV-shows (at least for now)

A project to practice backend. 


Used packages:
 - nodemon: to watch main file for any updates;
 - express: server implementation;
 - body-parser: to send data in requests;
 - morgan: to log all request to the server;
 - dotenv: to get access to the enviroment variables;
 - [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer): file uploading (formidable is an alternative);
 - [express-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-validator): perform validation (joi is an alternative)
 - mongoose : to connect with MongoDB



#### Notes
Middleware is cool! You can add all needed validation to it, without complicating thr function which actually handles request. Also you can add multiple middleware functions to separate logic (wow) :B)  

Validation is interesting :)
